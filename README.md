A WordPress version of my personal portfolio

WordPress made it quick and easy for me to put up the initial version of my personal portfolio but it wasn't what I wanted as a final product. It didn't seem appropriate for someone marketing himself as a developer.

I rewrote the website in the Spring of 2018 and retired my old WP website. But the WP site was up and active for a number of months and I did the work, so I thought I would mention it for those who may be looking for a WordPress site or for those looking to migrate from a WordPress site.

I didn't commit the files to github for a few reasons:
 * It would make for a huge repository, full of files produced by WordPress with a few custom files
 * The standard files are, for the most part, propietary to WordPress and I wanted to honor that fact.
 * Those files that are not proprietary to WP are the result of dragging and dropping resources into the WP environment.
 * The result is more a show case of the capabilities of WP, rather than me.
 * For anyone that is really interested, the files are archived and can be produced.

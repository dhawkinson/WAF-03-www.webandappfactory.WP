A WordPress version of my personal portfolio

WordPress made it quick and easy for me to put up the initial version of my personal portfolio but it wasn't what I wanted as a final product. It didn't seem appropriate for someone marketing himself as a developer.

I rewrote the website in the Spring of 2018 and retired my old WP website. But the WP site was up and active for a number of months and I did the work, so I thought I would mention it for those who may be looking for a WordPress site.

I didn't preserve the files for a couple of reasons:
 * They are really propietary to WordPress and I wanted to honor that fact.
 * Those files that are not proprietary to WP are, by and large, the result of dragging and dropping resources.
 * The resulting replacement product is superior to the original.
